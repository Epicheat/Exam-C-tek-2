# Tek 2 - C exam

If you are using this code in machine test, you can't have a note different of 21.  
To use it during a test, you can simply do the following from your std partition:

```bash
su root
mkdir /exam
mount /dev/sda6 /exam
mkdir /exam/cheat
cp . /exam/cheat/exam-c-tek-2 -R
umount /exam
rmdir /exam
```

Then, during a test, all this code will be in **/cheat**

```
